I am currently creating a program that displays a table with registered employees.
It allows you to add a new employee with name, position and salary.
It allows you to edit the data of an employee who is already registered.
It allows you to delete an employee from the list.
I am studying how to also add the database part, to save all this data from the employee registration.
